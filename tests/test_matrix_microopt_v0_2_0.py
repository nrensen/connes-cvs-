"""
Bit-identicality regression test for the v0.2.0 matrix-assembly micro-optimization.

The optimization drops the redundant ``mp.mpf(int)`` conversion in the Q-matrix
off-diagonal assembly loop in both ``connes_cvs.operator.build_galerkin_matrix``
and ``connes_cvs.runner.GalerkinCell``.  mpmath already handles ``mpf / int``
arithmetic at full precision, so the change should be bit-identical; this test
verifies that claim against the published Paper reference value
``2.86545361493028029516151514986747977533...e-59`` at c=13, N=100, T=800, dps=150
(see ``data/results_15pt_T800.json``).

Test design
-----------
The only code path touched by the optimization is the off-diagonal entry of
the Galerkin matrix::

    Q[i, j] = (psi_vals[m_idx] - psi_vals[n_idx]) / (m_idx - n_idx)   # new
    Q[i, j] = (psi_vals[m_idx] - psi_vals[n_idx]) / mp.mpf(m_idx - n_idx)  # old

The historical cache-backed checks below isolate this original v0.2 change.
Version 0.3 additionally mirrors the exact psi index parity and fills one
matrix triangle; dedicated raw-mpf tests in ``test_operator_hardening.py``
cover those newer arithmetic paths independently.

Instead, we load the pickled psi cache (produced by the pre-optimization code),
re-assemble the Galerkin matrix with the new code, run ``compute_ground_state``,
and compare the resulting ``lambda_even`` to the pickled value.  This isolates
the exact code path that changed, is deterministic, and fits in the 600s
budget.  A separate "very-slow" end-to-end test is provided (skipped by
default) that does call ``build_galerkin_matrix`` fully for users who want to
run the complete pipeline.

The comparison is performed on the first ``MATCH_DIGITS = 18`` significant
digits of ``mp.nstr`` representations (leading-digit agreement). It enforces
that explicit prefix and relative-error contract; it is not a raw-ULP test.

That reference pickle is a research-environment artifact and is not
distributed with this repository, so every pickle-backed test here skips on a
clean checkout.  The one check that needs no data, ``test_microopt_source_form``
(both assembly sites still carry the optimized ``/ (m_idx - n_idx)`` form), is
therefore kept unmarked and pickle-free so that it does run there.
